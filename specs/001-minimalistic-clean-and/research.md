# Research: Minimalistic Frontend with Hardcoded Data

**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Decisions  
**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Feature**: Minimalistic Frontend with Hardcoded Data

## Technology Decisions

### Frontend Framework: React + TypeScript + Vite

**Decision**: Use React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x and Vite as the build tool

**Rationale**: 
- React provides component-driven architecture aligned with Constitution Principle IV
- TypeScript ensures type safety and better developer experience
- Vite offers fast development with minimal configuration
- All technologies are mandatory per constitution

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Vue.js - Rejected due to constitution requirement for React
- Create React App - Rejected due to slower build times and heavier configuration
- Next.js - Rejected as overkill for simple frontend without SSR needs

### UI Framework: ShadCN + Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Use ShadCN UI components with Tailwind CSS

**Rationale**: 
- Mandatory per constitution for clean, consistent design language
- ShadCN provides pre-built accessible components
- Tailwind enables utility-first CSS for rapid development
- Minimal learning curve for simple components

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Material-UI - Rejected due to constitution requirement for ShadCN
- Chakra UI - Rejected due to constitution requirement for ShadCN
- Plain CSS - Rejected due to slower development and maintenance

### Routing: React Router

**Decision**: Use React Router v6 for client-side routing

**Rationale**: 
- Industry standard for React SPAs
- Simple declarative routing matches minimalist principle
- Supports browser history for proper navigation
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Reach Router - Deprecated, merged into React Router
- No routing (single page) - Rejected due to requirement for trip list and detail views
- Custom routing - Violates simplicity principle

### State Management: React Built-ins

**Decision**: Use React's built-in useState and useContext for local state

**Rationale**: 
- Hardcoded data doesn't require complex state management
- Reduces dependencies aligning with simplicity principle
- Built-in React patterns are sufficient for navigation state
- Future-ready for Zustand integration when needed

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Zustand - Reserved for future phases with more complex state needs
- Redux - Overkill for simple navigation state
- React Query - Not needed for hardcoded data (reserved for API phase)

### Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library

**Decision**: Use Vitest as test runner with React Testing Library

**Rationale**: 
- Vitest is Vite's native testing framework with better performance
- React Testing Library aligns with testing best practices
- Minimal configuration required
- Fast test execution

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Jest - Slower with additional configuration needed for Vite
- Cypress - Overkill for unit/component testing
- No testing - Violates development standards in constitution

### Data Structure: JSON with TypeScript Interfaces

**Decision**: Create hardcoded JSON data with strict TypeScript interfaces

**Rationale**: 
- Follows Trip/Place entity structure from README data model
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- Easy migration path to API integration later
- Supports UUID + updated_at pattern for future sync

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Plain JavaScript objects - Rejected due to lack of type safety
- Mock API - Unnecessary complexity for hardcoded phase
- Database integration - Out of scope for this phase

## Implementation Patterns

### Component Architecture

**Pattern**: Atomic design with composition
- UI atoms: ShadCN base components
- Molecules: TripCard, PlaceCard
- Organisms: TripList, TripDetails
- Pages: HomePage, TripPage

### Data Flow

**Pattern**: Props drilling with minimal context
- Hardcoded data imported at app level
- Passed down through component props
- Navigation state managed with React Router
- No global state needed for this phase

### Responsive Design

**Pattern**: Mobile-first Tailwind classes
- Base styles for mobile (320px+)
- Responsive modifiers for tablet (768px+) and desktop (1024px+)
- Flexbox and Grid for layout
- ShadCN components handle accessibility

## Development Setup

### Required Dependencies

**Core**:
- react (^18.2.0)
- react-dom (^18.2.0)
- react-router-dom (^6.8.0)
- typescript (^5.0.0)

**UI**:
- @radix-ui/react-* (ShadCN dependencies)
- tailwindcss (^3.3.0)
- class-variance-authority
- clsx
- lucide-react (icons)

**Build/Dev**:
- vite (^4.4.0)
- @vitejs/plugin-react (^4.0.0)

**Testing**:
- vitest (^0.34.0)
- @testing-library/react (^13.4.0)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (^6.0.0)

### Configuration Files

- `vite.config.ts`: Vite + React plugin configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN theming
- `tsconfig.json`: Strict TypeScript configuration
- `vitest.config.ts`: Test environment setup

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size
- Tree-shaking with Vite
- Import only needed ShadCN components
- Lazy loading for route components if needed

### Runtime Performance
- React.memo for expensive components
- Efficient re-renders with proper key props
- Minimal JavaScript for navigation

### Loading Performance
- Vite's fast cold start
- Pre-built ShadCN components
- Optimized Tailwind CSS purging

## Migration Path

This hardcoded frontend serves as foundation for:
1. **Phase 2**: Replace hardcoded data with IndexedDB
2. **Phase 3**: Add Zustand for complex state management
3. **Phase 4**: Integrate React Query for Supabase sync
4. **Phase 5**: Add offline-first capabilities

All architectural decisions support this progression while maintaining simplicity for the current phase.
