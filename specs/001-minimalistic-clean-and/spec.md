# Feature Specification: Minimalistic Frontend with Hardcoded Data

**Feature Branch**: `001-minimalistic-clean-and`  
**Created**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "minimalistic, clean and neat frontend for the application stated in #file:README.md let's use hardcoded json for data."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Trip List (Priority: P1)

A user visits the application and sees a clean, organized list of their trips with essential details like trip name, date range, and destination count.

**Why this priority**: This is the main entry point and provides immediate value by showing users their trips in a clear, accessible format.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the application and verifying that hardcoded trip data displays correctly in a clean list format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the application, **When** the homepage loads, **Then** they see a list of trips with name, dates, and place count
2. **Given** there are multiple trips, **When** the page loads, **Then** trips are displayed in chronological order
3. **Given** a trip has no places, **When** viewing the trip list, **Then** the place count shows as "0 places"

---

### User Story 2 - View Trip Details (Priority: P1)

A user clicks on a trip from the list and sees detailed information including all places, notes, and the ability to navigate through the itinerary.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core value of viewing trip details and places, which is essential for trip planning.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking on any trip from the list and verifying all trip details and places are displayed clearly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user clicks on a trip, **When** the trip detail page loads, **Then** they see trip name, dates, description, and all places
2. **Given** a trip has places, **When** viewing trip details, **Then** places are shown in order with names, Plus Codes, and notes
3. **Given** a trip has trip-level notes, **When** viewing details, **Then** the notes are prominently displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Navigate Between Views (Priority: P2)

A user can easily navigate back and forth between the trip list and individual trip details using clear navigation elements.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability but less critical than viewing data itself.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating between trip list and detail views multiple times to ensure smooth transitions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing trip details, **When** they click the back button, **Then** they return to the trip list
2. **Given** a user is on the trip list, **When** they click a different trip, **Then** they navigate to that trip's details
3. **Given** a user navigates between views, **When** switching pages, **Then** the interface remains responsive and clean

---

### User Story 4 - Responsive Design Display (Priority: P2)

A user can access the application on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and experience a clean, readable interface optimized for their screen size.

**Why this priority**: Modern web applications must work across devices, but the core functionality takes precedence.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the application on different screen sizes and verifying readability and usability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the app on mobile, **When** the page loads, **Then** content is readable and navigable on small screens
2. **Given** a user accesses the app on desktop, **When** the page loads, **Then** content uses available space effectively
3. **Given** a user rotates their mobile device, **When** orientation changes, **Then** the layout adapts appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a trip has no places added?
- How does the interface handle trips with many places (scrolling behavior)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of trips with name, date range, and place count using hardcoded JSON data
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to click on a trip to view detailed information
- **FR-003**: System MUST display trip details including name, dates, description, and all associated places
- **FR-004**: System MUST show places in order with name, Plus Code, and notes for each place
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear navigation between trip list and trip detail views
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-007**: System MUST use clean, minimalistic styling consistent with modern UI design principles
- **FR-008**: System MUST load hardcoded JSON data structure containing trips and places
- **FR-009**: System MUST display trip-level notes when available
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully (trips with no places, missing data)

### Key Entities

- **Trip**: Represents a travel itinerary with name, description, start/end dates, and associated places
- **Place**: Represents a location within a trip with name, Plus Code, notes, and order position
- **Navigation State**: Manages current view (trip list vs trip details) and selected trip

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the trip list within 2 seconds of page load
- **SC-002**: Users can navigate from trip list to trip details in under 1 second
- **SC-003**: Interface remains fully functional and readable on screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width
- **SC-004**: 100% of hardcoded trip and place data displays correctly without errors
- **SC-005**: Navigation between views works smoothly with no broken states or loading issues
- **SC-006**: Text remains readable and UI elements remain accessible across all supported screen sizes

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: How should the UI handle very long trip names or place descriptions? → A: Trip names assumed to be reasonable length, no special handling needed
- Q: How should the UI display places when Plus Codes are missing or invalid? → A: Invalid Plus Codes prevented at data creation level, not applicable for hardcoded data

## Assumptions

- The hardcoded JSON data will follow the data model structure outlined in the README (Trip and Place entities)
- Users will primarily interact with the application through web browsers
- The application will use modern CSS frameworks (ShadCN + Tailwind) as specified in the README
- No user authentication is required for this MVP since data is hardcoded
- No data persistence or editing capabilities are needed in this initial version
- Plus Codes will be displayed as-is without validation or Google Maps integration
- Trip names will be of reasonable length and not require special truncation handling
- All Plus Codes in hardcoded data are pre-validated and correct
