# Feature Specification: CSS Theme Management System

**Feature Branch**: `002-css-theming-for`  
**Created**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "css theming for this application. no need to have dark/light theme toggle. but would like to have externalise the theme easily. in case, if i don't like a theme, i can switch the theme in the code, build and deploy"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: What should be the primary source for predefined themes? → A: Use shadcn.studio standard themes as the primary predefined theme collection
- Q: How should theme switching be triggered during development workflow? → A: Build script parameter that can be passed without code changes
- Q: What should happen when an invalid or non-existent theme is specified? → A: Use default theme silently without any notification
- Q: Should the system support custom theme creation beyond the shadcn.studio collection? → A: No, restrict to only shadcn.studio predefined themes for consistency

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Theme Switching (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to change the entire visual theme of the application by modifying a single configuration point in the codebase, then rebuilding and deploying the application with the new theme.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested - the ability to easily swap themes at the code level without complex runtime switching mechanisms.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a theme configuration, running the build process, and verifying that all UI elements reflect the new theme consistently across all pages and components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is using the default theme, **When** a developer changes the theme configuration to "ocean-blue" theme and rebuilds, **Then** all components display with ocean-blue color palette
2. **Given** a developer wants to switch themes, **When** they modify the theme configuration file, **Then** the change requires only editing one primary configuration location
3. **Given** the application is rebuilt with a new theme, **When** users access any page, **Then** the new theme is applied consistently across all UI elements without any visual inconsistencies

---

### User Story 2 - Multiple Theme Creation (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to create new custom themes by defining color palettes and visual properties, then select which theme to use for deployment.

**Why this priority**: Enables theme customization and creation of multiple theme options that can be easily switched between.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new theme definition file, referencing it in the configuration, rebuilding the application, and verifying the custom theme is applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a new theme file with custom colors, **When** they configure the application to use this theme and rebuild, **Then** the application displays with the custom color scheme
2. **Given** multiple theme files exist, **When** a developer selects a different theme in configuration, **Then** only the selected theme is bundled and applied in the built application

---

### User Story 3 - Theme Component Coverage (Priority: P3)

A developer wants assurance that theme changes affect all visual elements consistently, including cards, buttons, navigation, typography, and backgrounds.

**Why this priority**: Ensures comprehensive theming coverage so no UI elements are left with inconsistent styling when themes are switched.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by switching themes and systematically checking all component types (cards, buttons, navigation, etc.) to verify they all reflect the new theme.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a theme is switched, **When** viewing trip cards, navigation, buttons, and other UI components, **Then** all elements use colors and styles from the selected theme
2. **Given** a new theme is applied, **When** viewing different pages (home, trip details), **Then** all pages maintain visual consistency with the selected theme

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a referenced theme file is missing or corrupted?
- How does the system handle invalid color values in theme definitions?
- What occurs if a theme is partially defined (missing some required color variables)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow developers to switch between different themes using build script parameters without modifying configuration files
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple predefined themes from shadcn.studio collection (e.g., default, zinc, slate, stone, gray, neutral, red, rose, orange, green, blue, yellow, violet)
- **FR-003**: System MUST apply theme changes consistently across all UI components including cards, buttons, navigation, typography, and backgrounds
- **FR-004**: System MUST restrict theme options to shadcn.studio predefined themes to maintain design consistency
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain theme definitions in separate, organized files for easy management
- **FR-006**: System MUST gracefully handle invalid themes by falling back to default theme silently
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure only the selected theme is included in the production build to optimize bundle size
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing responsive design and accessibility features when themes are switched
- **FR-009**: System MUST support theming of CSS custom properties (CSS variables) used throughout the application
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS styling

### Key Entities

- **Theme Configuration**: Central file that specifies which theme is currently active
- **Theme Definition**: Individual files containing color palettes, typography, and visual properties for specific themes
- **Theme Variables**: CSS custom properties that map theme values to UI components
- **Build Integration**: Build-time process that applies selected theme to the application bundle

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can switch the entire application theme by modifying a single configuration file
- **SC-002**: Theme changes are applied consistently across 100% of UI components without visual inconsistencies
- **SC-003**: Switching between available shadcn.studio themes requires no component code modifications
- **SC-004**: Build process generates optimized bundles containing only the selected theme (no unused theme code)
- **SC-005**: Theme switching maintains application performance with no degradation in load times or rendering speed
- **SC-006**: All existing responsive design breakpoints and accessibility features continue to work correctly with any theme
