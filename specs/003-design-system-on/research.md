# Design System Research & Decisions

**Feature**: Reusable Design System Built on ShadCN  
**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Context**: Research findings for enhanced UI components, typography systems, and theme integration patterns

## Component Enhancement Patterns

### Decision: Enhanced Card Component Architecture
**Rationale**: Build upon existing ShadCN card component with gradient overlays, hover animations, and consistent spacing tokens rather than creating entirely new components.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Building custom card components from scratch
- Using third-party card libraries
- Modifying existing trip cards directly

**Implementation approach**: Extend ShadCN Card with additional variant props for gradients, enhance with CSS custom properties for theme integration, add compound components pattern for card header/content/footer consistency.

## Typography System Design

### Decision: Tailwind-based Typography Scale with Custom Tokens
**Rationale**: Leverage existing Tailwind typography utilities while adding custom CSS properties for enhanced line-height and spacing consistency across components.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete custom typography system
- Third-party typography libraries (Typography.js)
- Pure CSS-based approach without Tailwind

**Implementation approach**: Define typography tokens as CSS custom properties, create utility classes extending Tailwind's text- system, implement typography component variants for consistent application.

## Theme Integration Strategy

### Decision: CSS Custom Properties with Tailwind Plugin
**Rationale**: Maintains compatibility with existing ShadCN theming while enabling runtime theme switching and multi-application reuse without build-time dependencies.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Tailwind config-based theming only
- Runtime CSS-in-JS theming
- SCSS variable-based theming

**Implementation approach**: Create theme configuration objects, generate CSS custom properties at runtime, extend Tailwind config to recognize custom properties, provide theme context provider for React components.

## Animation and Interactive States

### Decision: CSS Transitions with RequestAnimationFrame for Complex Animations
**Rationale**: Achieves 60fps performance target while maintaining accessibility compliance and providing fallback options for reduced motion preferences.

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS animations only
- JavaScript-based animation libraries (Framer Motion)
- Web Animations API

**Implementation approach**: Define transition tokens as CSS custom properties, implement hover/focus states with transform and shadow properties, use requestAnimationFrame for card scaling effects, respect prefers-reduced-motion media queries.

## Component Library Packaging

### Decision: ES Module Distribution with TypeScript Declarations
**Rationale**: Enables tree-shaking for optimal bundle sizes, provides full TypeScript support, and allows selective importing of components across applications.

**Alternatives considered**:
- UMD build for browser compatibility
- CommonJS for Node.js compatibility
- Single bundle approach

**Implementation approach**: Configure Vite for library mode, generate TypeScript declaration files, create multiple entry points for component categories, provide package.json exports map for selective imports.

## Accessibility Implementation

### Decision: WCAG AA Compliance with Enhanced Focus Management
**Rationale**: Meets stated 4.5:1 contrast ratio requirements while providing enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support beyond basic compliance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic WCAG A compliance
- WCAG AAA compliance (stricter)
- Custom accessibility patterns

**Implementation approach**: Implement aria-label and role attributes consistently, ensure proper focus order with tabindex management, provide high contrast mode variants, test with screen reader software.

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Component-Level Code Splitting with Lazy Loading
**Rationale**: Achieves <100ms render time target by loading only necessary components, reduces initial bundle size for multi-application usage.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single bundle for simplicity
- Route-level code splitting only
- Manual optimization without lazy loading

**Implementation approach**: Implement React.lazy for non-critical components, use dynamic imports for theme configurations, optimize CSS delivery with critical path extraction, implement component preloading for anticipated interactions.

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Component Testing with Visual Regression Detection
**Rationale**: Ensures design system consistency across applications while catching visual regressions that could impact user experience.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unit testing only
- End-to-end testing focus
- Manual testing approach

**Implementation approach**: Use React Testing Library for component behavior testing, implement Chromatic or similar for visual regression testing, create component story examples with Storybook, establish automated accessibility testing with axe-core.
