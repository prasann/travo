# Feature Specification: Reusable Design System Built on ShadCN

**Feature Branch**: `003-design-system-on`  
**Created**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Design system on top of ShadCN to make the app attractive and clear. I would like to keep this design system slightly independent, with an idea of reusing that in my another application as well."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Card Components with Visual Hierarchy (Priority: P1)

Designers and developers need to use consistent, visually appealing card components that automatically apply proper spacing, typography, and interactive states without having to remember specific styling rules each time.

**Why this priority**: Cards are the primary UI component in the travel app and establishing this foundation enables all other design system components to follow consistent patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing enhanced trip cards with gradient backgrounds, proper hover effects, and typography hierarchy, delivering immediate visual improvement to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer uses a design system card component, **When** they apply it to trip data, **Then** the card automatically displays with proper gradient background, 24px internal padding, and correct border radius
2. **Given** a user hovers over a card, **When** the hover state activates, **Then** the card shows enhanced shadow depth and subtle scale transform
3. **Given** a card contains trip information, **When** rendered, **Then** trip titles appear in large bold font, dates in accent color, and descriptions in proper hierarchy

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Typography and Spacing System (Priority: P2)

Developers need a consistent typography and spacing system that automatically applies correct font sizes, line heights, and spacing measurements across all components without manual specification.

**Why this priority**: Typography consistency is crucial for user experience and developer efficiency, and spacing consistency prevents layout issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by applying the typography system to existing pages and measuring consistency of font scales, spacing, and readability across different screen sizes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer applies typography classes, **When** they use system tokens, **Then** page titles render at text-2xl, section headers at text-xl, and body text at appropriate contrast ratios
2. **Given** multiple components use the spacing system, **When** rendered together, **Then** they maintain consistent 24px spacing between elements and 48px section spacing

### User Story 3 - Theme-Integrated Interactive Components (Priority: P3)

Users need all interactive elements (buttons, links, form inputs) to consistently use theme colors and provide clear visual feedback for hover, focus, and active states.

**Why this priority**: Interactive consistency builds user confidence and creates a polished experience, while theme integration ensures visual cohesion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with all buttons, links, and form elements to verify consistent theme color application and state feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user interacts with any button or link, **When** they hover or focus, **Then** the element shows theme color highlighting with proper accessibility indicators
2. **Given** form inputs receive focus, **When** a user navigates with keyboard, **Then** focus indicators are clearly visible and meet accessibility standards

---

### User Story 4 - Reusable Component Library Architecture (Priority: P4)

Developers working on multiple applications need to import and use design system components independently, with clear documentation and consistent APIs across different projects.

**Why this priority**: Enables code reuse across applications and maintains design consistency in the developer's broader project ecosystem.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a separate test project, importing design system components, and verifying they work independently with their own theming.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer imports design system components into a new project, **When** they follow the installation guide, **Then** components render correctly with default theming
2. **Given** components are used across different applications, **When** custom themes are applied, **Then** components adapt while maintaining their functionality and accessibility

### Edge Cases

- What happens when theme colors don't provide sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility compliance?
- How does the design system handle components that need custom styling beyond the system's scope?
- What occurs when components are used in applications with conflicting CSS frameworks or existing design systems?
- How does the system behave with missing or invalid theme configuration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Design system MUST provide enhanced card components with gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and consistent internal padding
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement a comprehensive typography hierarchy with defined font scales for titles, headers, body text, and secondary information
- **FR-003**: Components MUST integrate theme colors throughout all interactive elements and accent points
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide consistent spacing tokens for card spacing (24px), section spacing (48px), and element spacing (16px)
- **FR-005**: All interactive components MUST provide clear hover, focus, and active state feedback
- **FR-006**: Design system MUST maintain accessibility standards with proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support
- **FR-007**: Components MUST be packaged as reusable modules that can be imported into different applications
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide responsive design patterns that work across mobile and desktop screen sizes
- **FR-009**: Typography system MUST use relaxed line heights for optimal readability
- **FR-010**: Components MUST support customizable theming while maintaining design consistency
- **FR-011**: Interactive elements MUST provide visual feedback for click/tap actions
- **FR-012**: System MUST include proper visual depth through consistent shadow and layering systems

### Key Entities

- **Design System Package**: The reusable component library that can be installed in multiple applications
- **Component Variants**: Different visual states and configurations for each component type
- **Theme Configuration**: Customizable color, typography, and spacing definitions that components consume
- **Typography Scale**: Standardized font size and hierarchy system used across all text elements
- **Spacing System**: Consistent measurement tokens for margins, padding, and gaps
- **Interactive States**: Hover, focus, active, and disabled states for user interface elements

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All card components display consistent 24px internal padding and proper gradient backgrounds in under 100ms render time
- **SC-002**: Typography hierarchy achieves minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text to meet WCAG AA standards
- **SC-003**: Interactive elements respond to user input with visual feedback within 16ms to maintain 60fps performance
- **SC-004**: Design system components can be successfully imported and used in a separate test application within 15 minutes of installation
- **SC-005**: 95% of existing UI components can be replaced with design system equivalents without functionality loss
- **SC-006**: Responsive design patterns maintain readability and usability on screen sizes from 320px to 2560px width
- **SC-007**: Component documentation enables developers to implement new features 40% faster compared to custom styling
- **SC-008**: Theme customization allows for complete visual rebrand within 2 hours of configuration changes

## Assumptions

- The existing ShadCN UI library provides the foundational component structure
- Current Tailwind CSS configuration supports the required design tokens
- Applications using the design system will maintain React as the primary framework
- Theme customization will be handled through CSS custom properties or configuration files
- Components will be distributed as an npm package or similar module system
- Existing trip data structure remains compatible with enhanced card components
- Development teams have basic familiarity with component-based architecture
- Applications will maintain modern browser support (ES6+ JavaScript environments)
