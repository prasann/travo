# Tasks: Reusable Design System Built on ShadCN

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-design-system-on/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in this specification, so no test tasks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Frontend project**: `travo-frontend/src/`, `travo-frontend/tests/`
- Paths based on plan.md structure extending existing React application

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and design system structure

- [x] T001 Create design system directory structure in travo-frontend/src/components/design-system/
- [x] T002 Create design system styles directory in travo-frontend/src/styles/design-system/
- [x] T003 [P] Create design system utilities directory in travo-frontend/src/lib/design-system/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent foundation for all other components
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on typography tokens but independent
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses theme system but independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent packaging and architecture work

### Within Each User Story

- Enhanced components before application integration
- Core component implementation before usage updates
- Style definitions before component implementations that use them
- Utility functions before components that depend on them

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- Component creation tasks within stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Documentation and styling tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all component creation for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create enhanced Card component in travo-frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx"
Task: "Create Typography component with hierarchy variants in travo-frontend/src/components/ui/typography.tsx"

# Launch all export and integration tasks together:
Task: "Add card component exports to travo-frontend/src/components/ui/index.ts"
Task: "Add design system exports to travo-frontend/src/components/design-system/index.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - establishes design tokens and theme system)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Enhanced Cards)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test enhanced card components independently
5. Deploy enhanced trip cards to see immediate visual improvement

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Design system foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Enhanced cards available ‚Üí Deploy visual improvements
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Typography consistency ‚Üí Deploy improved readability
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Interactive consistency ‚Üí Deploy polished interactions
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Reusable package ‚Üí Enable multi-application use

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Enhanced Cards)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Typography System)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Interactive Components)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Package Architecture)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
