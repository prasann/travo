# Specification Quality Checklist: Port App to Next.js and Replace ShadCN with DaisyUI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Initial Validation - October 11, 2025**

✅ **Content Quality**: PASSED
- Specification focuses on "what" needs to happen (migration, replacement, preservation of functionality)
- Written in business terms without technical implementation details
- All mandatory sections are present and complete
- User-centric language throughout

✅ **Requirement Completeness**: PASSED
- All functional requirements are clear and testable
- Success criteria include specific, measurable metrics (30% fewer files, under 2 seconds load time, etc.)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details while remaining measurable
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format properly
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios
- No ambiguous requirements requiring clarification

✅ **Feature Readiness**: PASSED
- Each functional requirement can be validated through testing
- User stories cover all primary flows (list view, detail view, theming)
- Success criteria map to business value (simpler codebase, maintained performance)
- Scope is well-defined: migration + replacement, not new features

**Summary**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. No blocking issues found.
