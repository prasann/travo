# Feature Specification: Port App to Next.js and Replace ShadCN with DaisyUI

**Feature Branch**: `004-port-app-to`  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Port app to NextJS and replace ShadCN with DaisyUI for simpler codebase"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Trip List (Priority: P1)

Users can view a list of all their trips in a clean, organized interface using the new Next.js architecture with DaisyUI components. The experience should be identical to the current app but with simplified code maintenance.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary entry point and most frequently used feature. Users must be able to browse trips immediately upon landing on the app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the home page and verifying all trips from the JSON data display correctly with proper styling and delivers the core browsing experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user visits the home page, **When** the page loads, **Then** all trips from the data source display in a list format with trip cards showing key information
2. **Given** trips are loading, **When** data is being fetched, **Then** a loading indicator appears
3. **Given** trip list is displayed, **When** user views the page, **Then** the DaisyUI card components render properly with consistent styling

---

### User Story 2 - View Trip Details (Priority: P2)

Users can click on any trip to view detailed information including all places within that trip, using Next.js routing and DaisyUI components for a cleaner implementation.

**Why this priority**: This is the second-most critical user journey - viewing details after selecting a trip. Essential for the app's core value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking any trip card and verifying the detail page loads with complete trip information and place cards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on home page with trip list, **When** user clicks on a trip card, **Then** user navigates to trip detail page showing trip information and associated places
2. **Given** user is on trip detail page, **When** page loads, **Then** all places within the trip display with proper formatting using DaisyUI components
3. **Given** user is on trip detail page, **When** user wants to return, **Then** navigation back to home page works correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Theme Support (Priority: P3)

The app continues to support multiple color themes (blue, green, red, violet, default) but implemented using DaisyUI's theming system for simpler maintenance.

**Why this priority**: Theming is a nice-to-have feature that enhances user experience but isn't critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching between different theme builds and verifying consistent styling across all pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app is built with a specific theme, **When** user visits any page, **Then** the selected theme's color scheme applies consistently
2. **Given** app uses DaisyUI themes, **When** developer needs to modify theme, **Then** changes can be made through DaisyUI configuration without custom CSS

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when trips.json is empty or missing?
- How does the app handle invalid trip IDs in URLs (e.g., /trip/nonexistent-id)?
- What happens when a trip has no places associated with it?
- How does the app behave with very long trip names or descriptions?
- What happens on slow network connections during page transitions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all existing routes (home page, trip detail page, 404 page) from React Router to Next.js App Router
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace all ShadCN UI components (Button, Card, Typography) with equivalent DaisyUI components
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain existing theme system with all five color schemes (blue, green, red, violet, default) using DaisyUI's theming approach
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality including trip list display, trip detail navigation, and error boundaries
- **FR-005**: System MUST load trip data from the same JSON file structure without changes to data format
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain TypeScript type safety across all components and pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure build scripts support theme-specific builds (e.g., dev:blue, build:green)
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement responsive design using DaisyUI's utility classes matching current responsive behavior
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle loading states consistently across all pages
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain clean code structure with reduced complexity compared to current ShadCN implementation

### Key Entities

- **Trip**: Represents a travel trip with properties including id, name, description, dates, destination, and associated places
- **Place**: Represents a location within a trip with properties including id, name, description, and trip association
- **Theme**: Represents a color scheme configuration with predefined color variables and styling rules

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All existing pages (home, trip details, 404) function identically to current implementation after migration
- **SC-002**: Codebase has at least 30% fewer UI component files compared to current ShadCN implementation (from 4 UI component files to 3 or fewer)
- **SC-003**: Build time for production builds improves or remains within 10% of current build time
- **SC-004**: Page load time for home page remains under 2 seconds on standard broadband connection
- **SC-005**: All five theme variants build successfully and display correct color schemes
- **SC-006**: Type checking passes with zero TypeScript errors across entire codebase
- **SC-007**: Developers can modify styling through DaisyUI configuration without writing custom CSS files for basic component changes
