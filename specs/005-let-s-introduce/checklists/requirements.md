# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Database Layer with IndexedDB

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No \[NEEDS CLARIFICATION\] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- Trip deletion behavior: Resolved with soft delete approach (Option C)
  - Trips are marked as deleted but preserved in database
  - Associated places remain intact
  - Restore functionality included in specification

**Quality Assessment**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- 7 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 18 functional requirements + 4 non-functional requirements
- 7 measurable success criteria
- Clear scope boundaries with out-of-scope items documented
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Data abstraction layer properly specified for future Supabase migration

## Notes

All checklist items are complete. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
