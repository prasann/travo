# Feature Specification: Local Database Layer with IndexedDB

**Feature Branch**: `005-let-s-introduce`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Let's introduce a local database using IndexDB. We will need this to perform, edit and add new data to our app. For now, let's load this JSON into the DB at the start of the app. then we will read from the DB instead of the JSON file. and perform operations on the DB. JSON is merely a seed data for the DB. eventually we will add a sync mechanism to sync the local DB with a remote DB. (Supabase) For now, let's focus on getting the local DB working. once this is done, we will work on UI part for adding/editing/deleting data. that's not a scope for now. we will use Dexie.js as a wrapper around IndexDB to make it easier to work. ensure to keep the data layer separate from the UI layer. in future, i might directly make calls to Supabase, and UI layer should not be affected by this change."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

- Q: Data Validation Rules - What validation rules should apply when creating or updating trips? → A: Required fields + format validation (dates must be valid dates, no end before start)
- Q: Error Handling for Quota Exceeded - How should the system handle IndexedDB quota exceeded situations? → A: Block operation and display error message to user (read-only mode)
- Q: Concurrent Multi-Tab Behavior - What happens when multiple tabs are open? → A: Not applicable - single user application, multi-tab scenarios ignored
- Q: Corrupted Seed Data Handling - How should initialization handle corrupted or invalid seed JSON? → A: Fail initialization completely, show error, require user intervention
- Q: Observability Requirements - What level of logging/monitoring is needed? → A: No logging - errors shown to user only, no internal logs
- Q: Implementation Scope - What level of implementation is needed? → A: Build only data layer interfaces for add/edit/delete operations; no UI integration; keep schema simple without strict validation initially

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initial Data Loading from Seed (Priority: P1)

When a user first launches the application, the system automatically initializes the local database with trip data from the JSON seed file. This ensures users have data available immediately without manual setup.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational - without data in the database, no other operations can be tested or demonstrated. It represents the minimum viable functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clearing browser storage, launching the app, and verifying that trip data is accessible without requiring the JSON file to be loaded again. Delivers immediate value by making data persistent across sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is launched for the first time with an empty database, **When** the app initializes, **Then** all trip data from the seed JSON file is loaded into the local database
2. **Given** the database already contains data, **When** the app initializes, **Then** the system does not reload the seed data and preserves existing database content
3. **Given** the seed JSON file is corrupted or contains invalid data, **When** initialization attempts to load the data, **Then** the system fails initialization completely, displays a clear error message indicating the corruption, and requires user intervention to fix the seed file
4. **Given** the seed data loading process encounters a database error, **When** initialization fails, **Then** the system provides clear feedback about the failure and allows retry

---

### User Story 2 - Reading Trip Data from Database (Priority: P1)

The application reads all trip information from the local database instead of directly from JSON files. Users see their trip data displayed in the UI, sourced from the persistent local database.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary value delivery - users need to view their data. Without this, the database serves no purpose. It's independently valuable and testable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding data to the database, refreshing the application, and verifying that all trip information displays correctly. Delivers value by ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the database contains trip data, **When** a user navigates to the trip list page, **Then** all trips are displayed with information retrieved from the database
2. **Given** the database contains trip data, **When** a user views a specific trip detail page, **Then** all trip information including places is retrieved from the database
3. **Given** the database is empty, **When** a user accesses the trip list, **Then** the system displays an appropriate empty state message
4. **Given** a database read operation fails, **When** the system attempts to retrieve trip data, **Then** the error is handled gracefully with a user-friendly message

---

### User Story 3 - Creating New Trip Records (Priority: P2)

Users can add new trip records to the local database. The data layer accepts new trip information and persists it to the local database, making it immediately available for retrieval.

**Why this priority**: This enables users to expand their data beyond the seed content. It's the first write operation and validates the database layer's mutability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by programmatically adding a new trip record through the data layer API and verifying it appears in subsequent queries. Delivers value by proving data persistence works for user-generated content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid trip information is provided, **When** the data layer creates a new trip, **Then** the trip is successfully stored in the database with a unique identifier
2. **Given** a trip is successfully created, **When** the trip list is retrieved, **Then** the new trip appears in the results
3. **Given** invalid trip data is provided, **When** attempting to create a trip, **Then** the operation fails with clear validation feedback
4. **Given** a database write operation fails, **When** attempting to create a trip, **Then** the error is caught and reported without crashing the application

---

### User Story 4 - Updating Existing Trip Records (Priority: P2)

The data layer can modify existing trip records in the local database. Changes are persisted immediately and reflected in subsequent data retrievals.

**Why this priority**: Essential for data maintenance and correction. Users need to update trip details as plans change. Independent from UI, focuses on data integrity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a trip, modifying its properties through the data layer API, and verifying the changes persist across queries. Delivers value by ensuring data accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trip exists in the database, **When** the data layer updates the trip with new information, **Then** the changes are successfully persisted
2. **Given** a trip has been updated, **When** the trip is retrieved, **Then** all updated fields reflect the new values
3. **Given** an invalid trip ID is provided, **When** attempting to update a trip, **Then** the operation fails with an appropriate error
4. **Given** invalid update data is provided, **When** attempting to update a trip, **Then** validation errors are returned without corrupting existing data

---

### User Story 5 - Deleting Trip Records (Priority: P3)

The data layer can remove trip records from the local database. Deleted trips are immediately removed and no longer appear in queries.

**Why this priority**: Important for data management but less critical than creating and updating. Users need to clean up unwanted data. Completes the CRUD operations set.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a trip, deleting it through the data layer API, and verifying it no longer appears in queries. Delivers value by allowing users to manage their data lifecycle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trip exists in the database, **When** the data layer deletes the trip, **Then** the trip is marked as deleted (soft delete) but remains in the database
2. **Given** a trip has been deleted, **When** querying for all trips, **Then** the deleted trip does not appear in results unless specifically requesting deleted items
3. **Given** an invalid trip ID is provided, **When** attempting to delete a trip, **Then** the operation fails with an appropriate error
4. **Given** a trip has associated places, **When** the trip is deleted, **Then** the associated places are preserved and remain accessible in the database

---

### User Story 6 - Managing Place Records within Trips (Priority: P3)

The data layer supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting place records associated with trips. Place operations maintain referential integrity with their parent trips.

**Why this priority**: Places are subordinate to trips. While important for complete functionality, trip-level operations are more critical. Independent test demonstrates nested data handling.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a trip, adding places to it, modifying those places, and verifying all operations maintain data integrity. Delivers value by enabling detailed trip planning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trip exists, **When** adding a new place to the trip, **Then** the place is successfully stored with proper reference to the parent trip
2. **Given** a trip has places, **When** retrieving the trip, **Then** all associated places are included in the result
3. **Given** a place exists, **When** updating place information, **Then** the changes are persisted and reflected in subsequent queries
4. **Given** a place exists, **When** deleting the place, **Then** the place is removed but the parent trip remains intact

---

### User Story 7 - Recovering Soft-Deleted Trips (Priority: P3)

The data layer provides capability to restore trips that have been soft-deleted, allowing users to recover accidentally deleted data.

**Why this priority**: Recovery functionality is important for data safety but not essential for core operations. It provides a safety net for user errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by soft-deleting a trip, querying for deleted trips, restoring it, and verifying it reappears in normal queries. Delivers value by preventing permanent data loss from accidental deletions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trip has been soft-deleted, **When** querying for deleted trips, **Then** the deleted trip appears in the results with its deletion status
2. **Given** a soft-deleted trip exists, **When** the data layer restores the trip, **Then** the trip is marked as active and appears in normal queries
3. **Given** a trip with associated places is soft-deleted and restored, **When** the trip is retrieved after restoration, **Then** all associated places remain intact and accessible

---

### Edge Cases

- When the browser's IndexedDB quota is exceeded during data operations, the system blocks write operations and displays an error message to the user, while maintaining read-only access to existing data.
- If the seed JSON file is corrupted or contains invalid data during initial load, initialization fails completely with a clear error message requiring user intervention to fix the seed file before proceeding.
- How does the system behave when IndexedDB is not supported or disabled in the browser?
- What happens when a database operation is interrupted (e.g., user closes browser during write)?
- How are data migrations handled when the database schema needs to change in future versions?
- What happens when the database becomes corrupted or inaccessible?
- What happens if a user attempts to restore a trip that was already restored or was never deleted?
- How long should soft-deleted trips be retained before permanent deletion (if ever)?

### Key Entities

- **Trip**: Represents a travel itinerary with metadata. Required fields: unique identifier, title (string), start date, end date. Optional fields: location, deletion status (boolean, defaults to false). Contains zero or more associated places. Supports soft deletion allowing recovery of accidentally deleted trips. Schema kept simple for initial implementation.
- **Place**: Represents a specific location or point of interest within a trip. Required fields: unique identifier, name (string), parent trip reference. Optional fields: description, timing. Each place belongs to exactly one trip and persists through trip soft delete/restore operations.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Application loads and displays trip data from the local database within 2 seconds on initial launch
- **SC-002**: All database read operations return results within 500ms for datasets containing up to 100 trips with 500 total places
- **SC-003**: Data persists across browser sessions with 100% reliability (no data loss on page refresh or browser restart)
- **SC-004**: Database initialization completes successfully on 95% of supported browsers without user intervention
- **SC-005**: All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both trips and places function correctly with zero UI-layer coupling
- **SC-006**: Data layer API can be independently tested without launching the UI, with 100% of operations executable via programmatic interface
- **SC-007**: Switching from JSON file to database storage requires zero changes to existing UI components (proves abstraction is effective)

## Assumptions

- Browser supports IndexedDB (standard in all modern browsers since 2015)
- Seed JSON file is well-formed and follows the current data structure
- Typical dataset size will not exceed 1000 trips with 5000 total places for local storage
- Users primarily access the application from a single browser (multi-device sync is future scope)
- Database schema versioning will follow a simple incrementing version number approach
- Dexie.js library will be used as the IndexedDB wrapper for simplified API access
- Application is client-side only for this phase (no server-side components)
- Browser storage quota is sufficient for expected data volumes (IndexedDB typically allows 50MB+ per origin)
- Soft-deleted trips will be retained indefinitely for recovery purposes (no automatic permanent deletion)
- Deletion status is tracked as a boolean flag on trip records
- Initial implementation prioritizes functional interfaces over strict schema validation
- Complex validation rules and business logic will be added in future iterations

## Constraints

- Implementation focuses on data layer interfaces only - no UI integration for add/edit/delete operations
- Schema kept simple initially without strict validation constraints
- No UI changes are included in this feature scope (UI for adding/editing/deleting will be separate future work)
- Remote database synchronization (Supabase) is explicitly out of scope for this phase
- Single user application - multi-tab scenarios and synchronization not considered
- Offline-first architecture will be implemented (no network dependency for core operations)

## Out of Scope

- User interface for data entry, editing, or deletion
- Remote database synchronization with Supabase
- Real-time collaboration or multi-user access
- Multi-tab synchronization or conflict resolution
- Data export/import functionality beyond initial seed loading
- Advanced query capabilities (filtering, sorting, search)
- Data backup or restore mechanisms
- Migration tools for existing user data
- Authentication or authorization
