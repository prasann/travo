# Tasks: Local Database Layer with IndexedDB (Enhanced Model)

**Feature**: 005-let-s-introduce  
**Date**: 2025-10-12 (Revised)  
**Input**: Updated design documents incorporating enhanced data model from merged main branch

**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/interfaces.ts

**Revision Note**: Tasks updated to support enhanced data model with 9 entity types (Trip, Flight, FlightLeg, Hotel, DailyActivity, RestaurantRecommendation, TripIndex) instead of original 2 entities (Trip, Place).

**Tests**: No tests explicitly requested in specification - test tasks excluded from this implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by implementation phase, with critical foundational work before user story implementation.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Phase] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Phase]**: Which phase this task belongs to (Setup, Foundation, US1, US2, etc.)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a web application with frontend-only implementation:
- **Frontend Code**: `frontend/lib/db/` for database layer
- **Seed Data**: `frontend/data/trips/` (one JSON per trip) + `frontend/data/trip-index.json`
- **Types**: `frontend/types/index.ts` (enhanced types from main) + `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (DB-specific)
- **No backend**: Client-side database only

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Dependencies

**Purpose**: Install dependencies and verify environment

- [x] T001 Install Dexie.js 4.x dependency in frontend (`cd frontend && npm install dexie@^4.0.0`)
- [x] T002 [P] Install uuid for UUID generation (`cd frontend && npm install uuid@^9.0.0`)
- [x] T003 [P] Install TypeScript type definitions (`cd frontend && npm install --save-dev @types/uuid fake-indexeddb`)
- [x] T004 Create database layer directory structure (`frontend/lib/db/` with subdirectories `operations/`)

**Checkpoint**: Dependencies installed - foundation ready for type system work

---

## Phase 2: Type System Reconciliation (CRITICAL - BLOCKING) üî•

**Purpose**: Merge database types with enhanced domain types from main branch

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This phase MUST complete before ANY other implementation work can begin

- [x] T005 Backup current `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` to `frontend/lib/db/models-original.ts`
- [x] T006 Rewrite `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` to import base types from `@/types` (Trip, Flight, FlightLeg, Hotel, DailyActivity, RestaurantRecommendation, TripIndex)
- [x] T007 Add Trip extension with `deleted: boolean` field in `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (database-specific field)
- [x] T008 [P] Create Input types for all entities in `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (TripInput, FlightInput, HotelInput, ActivityInput, RestaurantInput, FlightLegInput - omit id/updated_at)
- [x] T009 [P] Create Update types for all entities in `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (TripUpdate, FlightUpdate, HotelUpdate, ActivityUpdate, RestaurantUpdate, FlightLegUpdate - partial with id required)
- [x] T010 [P] Create query result types in `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (TripWithRelations extending Trip with flights[], hotels[], activities[], restaurants[])
- [x] T011 Keep existing DbError types and Result<T> pattern in `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (no changes needed)
- [x] T012 Keep existing error type guards in `frontend/lib/db/models.ts` (isValidationError, isQuotaExceededError, isDatabaseError, isNotFoundError)
- [x] T013 Update imports in `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` to use new models.ts structure
- [x] T014 [P] Update imports in `frontend/lib/db/errors.ts` to use new models.ts structure
- [x] T015 [P] Update imports in `frontend/lib/db/validation.ts` to use new models.ts structure
- [x] T016 [P] Update imports in `frontend/lib/db/init.ts` to use new models.ts structure
- [x] T017 [P] Update imports in `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` to use new models.ts structure

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Type system unified - all imports working, ready for schema extension

---

## Phase 3: Schema Extension (CRITICAL - BLOCKING) üî•

**Purpose**: Extend Dexie schema to support all 9 entity types

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This phase MUST complete before seed loading or CRUD operations

- [x] T019 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` - Add flightLegs table definition with indexes (id, flight_id, [flight_id+leg_number])
- [x] T020 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` - Add hotels table definition with indexes (id, trip_id, check_in_time, city, updated_at)
- [x] T021 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` - Add activities table definition with indexes (id, trip_id, date, [trip_id+date+order_index], city, updated_at)
- [x] T022 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` - Add restaurants table definition with indexes (id, trip_id, city, updated_at)
- [x] T023 Update `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` - Update trips table indexes to include start_date, end_date for range queries
- [x] T024 Update `frontend/lib/db/schema.ts` - Implement version 2 schema migration (upgrade function from v1)
- [x] T025 Add TypeScript table declarations in schema.ts (flights!: Table<Flight, string>, flightLegs!: Table<FlightLeg, string>, etc.)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Schema v2 complete with all 6 tables - ready for seed loading

---

## Phase 4: Seed Loader Update (HIGH PRIORITY) üü°

**Purpose**: Update seed loader to support multi-file structure with enhanced entities

- [x] T026 Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Read trip-index.json to get list of trip IDs
- [x] T027 Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Implement loadTripFromFile(tripId) function to read from `/frontend/data/trips/{id}.json`
- [x] T028 Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Parse Trip base properties from JSON (id, name, description, start_date, end_date, home_location, updated_at)
- [x] T029 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Parse Flight array from trip JSON, extract flight properties
- [x] T030 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Parse FlightLeg array from each flight, flatten to separate array
- [x] T031 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Parse Hotel array from trip JSON
- [x] T032 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Parse DailyActivity array from trip JSON
- [x] T033 [P] Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Parse RestaurantRecommendation array from trip JSON
- [x] T034 Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Implement bulk insert transaction (trips first, then all child entities in parallel)
- [x] T035 Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Add validation for nested structure (flights, hotels, activities, restaurants present)
- [x] T036 Update `frontend/lib/db/seed.ts` - Update error handling for multi-file loading failures
- [x] T037 Update `frontend/lib/db/init.ts` - Update isInitialized check to verify all tables have data

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Seed loading works with multi-file structure - database initializes with full enhanced data

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)
```
Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Type System) ‚Üí Phase 3 (Schema) ‚Üí Phase 4 (Seed Loader)
```

### User Stories (Can Execute After Phase 4)
```
Phase 4 complete ‚Üí Phase 5 (US1) + Phase 6 (US2) - Independent
Phase 6 complete ‚Üí Phase 7 (US3) + Phase 8 (US4) - Independent  
Phase 8 complete ‚Üí Phase 9 (US5) + Phase 10 (US6) + Phase 11 (US7) - Independent
```

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Type System)**: T008, T009, T010 can run in parallel (different type categories)

**Phase 3 (Schema)**: T019-T022 can run in parallel (different tables)

**Phase 4 (Seed Loader)**: T029-T033 can run in parallel (parsing different entity types)

**Phase 6 (US2 Read Operations)**: T047-T051 can run in parallel (different entity operation files)

**Phase 7 (US3 Create Operations)**: T061-T065, T067-T070 can run in parallel (different entities)

**Phase 8 (US4 Update Operations)**: T077-T080 can run in parallel (different entities)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
- **Phase 1-4**: Setup through Seed Loader (REQUIRED)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 1 (seed loading verification)
- **Phase 6**: User Story 2 (read operations)

**Delivers**: Database initialized, data loaded, read operations working. This is enough to replace JSON file reads in UI.

### Incremental Delivery
- **Iteration 1**: MVP (Phases 1-6) - 15-20 hours
- **Iteration 2**: Create/Update (Phases 7-8) - 8-10 hours
- **Iteration 3**: Delete/Recovery (Phases 9-11) - 4-6 hours
- **Iteration 4**: Polish (Phase 12) - 3-4 hours

**Total Estimated**: 30-40 hours of focused development time

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 119
- Setup & Dependencies: 4 tasks (T001-T004) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Type System: 13 tasks (T005-T017)
- Schema Extension: 8 tasks (T018-T025)
- Seed Loader: 12 tasks (T026-T037)
- User Story 1: 7 tasks (T038-T044)
- User Story 2: 15 tasks (T045-T059)
- User Story 3: 16 tasks (T060-T075)
- User Story 4: 11 tasks (T076-T086)
- User Story 5: 10 tasks (T087-T096)
- User Story 6: 3 tasks (T097-T099)
- User Story 7: 8 tasks (T100-T107)
- Polish & Integration: 12 tasks (T108-T119)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35 tasks marked with [P] can run concurrently

**Complexity**: Enhanced from original 2 entities to 9 entities
- Original estimate: ~30 tasks for Trip/Place only
- Enhanced estimate: 119 tasks for full enhanced model
- 4x increase justified by 4.5x entity increase and richer data model

---

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Type System First**: Phase 2 is absolutely critical and blocks everything else
2. **Schema Before Data**: Must have schema v2 complete before seed loading
3. **Test with Real Data**: Use existing trip JSON files from `/frontend/data/trips/` for testing
4. **Performance Matters**: Watch for index usage, bulk operations, transaction wrapping
5. **Error Handling**: Every operation returns Result<T>, no exceptions thrown
6. **UI Separation**: Database layer has zero UI dependencies, can be tested independently
7. **Future-Proof**: Design supports Supabase migration (UUIDs, timestamps, API abstraction)

---

## Success Criteria per User Story

- **US1**: Seed data loads all 6 tables on first launch
- **US2**: Read operations return all entity types with <100ms for full trip
