# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Trip Data Model & Itinerary Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass**: Specification focuses entirely on WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies. All requirements describe user needs and business value.

✅ **Pass**: Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Terms like "System MUST" and user-centric descriptions make it clear what the feature delivers.

✅ **Pass**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantive content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **Pass**: All 19 functional requirements are testable. Each can be verified through observation or measurement (e.g., FR-004 can be tested by checking if flight details are captured correctly).

✅ **Pass**: Success criteria include specific metrics (3 seconds for SC-001, 80% for SC-005, 50+ activities for SC-007) and are measurable.

✅ **Pass**: Success criteria describe outcomes from user perspective without implementation details (e.g., "Users can view complete day-by-day itinerary" not "API returns JSON in X format").

✅ **Pass**: Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format and cover main user flows for all three priority levels.

✅ **Pass**: Seven edge cases identified covering overnight flights, multi-leg flights, schedule conflicts, timezones, missing data, and multi-day activities.

✅ **Pass**: Scope is bounded by the 19 functional requirements. Data organization (FR-017 to FR-019) explicitly preserves existing functionality, preventing scope creep.

✅ **Pass**: Dependencies are implicit but clear - feature builds on existing trip/place data model. Assumption about Google Maps integration readiness is documented in FR-013.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass**: Each functional requirement group (Trip Structure, Flight Info, Accommodation, etc.) has corresponding acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **Pass**: Three prioritized user stories cover: core itinerary (P1), restaurant recommendations (P2), and visual enhancements (P3). This provides a clear implementation path.

✅ **Pass**: All 8 success criteria directly support the user scenarios and functional requirements. They provide clear targets for feature completion.

✅ **Pass**: Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout. File storage (FR-003) mentions JSON only as data format, not implementation detail.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All checklist items passed on first validation
- No clarifications needed from user
- Minor markdown linting issues (MD036 - emphasis as heading) don't impact specification quality
