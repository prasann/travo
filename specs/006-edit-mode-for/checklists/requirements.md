# Specification Quality Checklist: Trip Edit Mode

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec successfully avoids mentioning specific frameworks, languages, or technical implementation details. References to IndexedDB and Google Maps API are appropriate as they describe what the system does (persist data, retrieve location data) rather than how to implement it.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly explain the value proposition and why each priority level was assigned. The specification centers on user needs and business outcomes.

✅ **Non-technical language**: The specification is written in plain language that stakeholders without technical backgrounds can understand. Terms like "edit mode," "place," and "note" are domain concepts, not technical jargon.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are specific and actionable.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-024) describes a specific, verifiable behavior. For example, "System MUST provide an edit button on the trip page" can be tested by checking for the button's presence.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) include specific metrics:
- Time-based: "within 2 clicks," "in under 30 seconds," "within 2 seconds," "within 3 seconds," "in under 2 minutes"
- Quantitative: "100% of saved changes persist," "at least 50 places per trip category"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user experience outcomes rather than technical implementation. For example, "Users can add a new place using a Plus Code in under 30 seconds" describes the user experience without specifying how the system achieves this.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of the 5 user stories includes specific Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios that define testable conditions.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: The specification lists 6 edge cases covering network failures, concurrent edits, unsaved changes, ambiguous results, storage limits, and API quotas.

✅ **Scope bounded**: The specification clearly defines what is included (edit mode, Plus Code entry, notes at multiple levels) and what is excluded (autocomplete, editing auto-populated fields, timeline view changes).

✅ **Dependencies identified**: The specification identifies key dependencies:
- Google Maps API for Plus Code resolution
- IndexedDB for data persistence
- Existing timeline view (which must remain unchanged)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: All 24 functional requirements have implicit acceptance criteria through their specific, testable language. The 5 user stories include explicit acceptance scenarios.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: User scenarios cover the complete user journey from accessing edit mode, through adding/modifying/deleting content, to saving and returning to view mode.

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: All 8 success criteria define specific, verifiable outcomes that can be measured during acceptance testing.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The specification maintains appropriate abstraction levels. References to IndexedDB and Google Maps API describe system capabilities, not implementation approaches.

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Minor observation**: The specification includes some markdown lint warnings about using emphasis instead of headings for subsection groupings (Edit Mode Access & Navigation, Place Management, etc.). These are stylistic and do not affect specification quality or readiness.
